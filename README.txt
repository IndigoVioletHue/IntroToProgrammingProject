CS12020 Graphics and Games project - 2023
Aaron Bowring

Programs are designed for use with the AU LED Screen Board

Libraries Used:
AberLED (https://users.aber.ac.uk/jcf12/downloads/AberLED.zip)
EEPROM (Arduino Builtin)

Please run EEPROM_setup first to setup the EEPROM with the right values, or the game will not work as intended!

I kept the mass-writing of the EEPROM seperate to the main program to hopefully extend its lifetime, I hope this is acceptable!
